                             Building Documentation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After building and testing your local instance of Tarantool, you can build a local version of this documentation and contribute to it. 

Documentation is based on the python-based Sphinx generator. So, make sure to install all python modules indicated in the BUILDING FROM SOURCE (http://tarantool.org/doc/dev_guide/building_from_source.html) section of this documentation. The procedure below implies that you already took those steps and successfully tested your instance of Tarantool.

1. Build a local version of the existing documentation package.

Run the following set of commands (the example below is based on Ubuntu OS, but the precedure is similar for other supported OS's):

   .. code-block:: bash

    cd ~/tarantool
    cmake -DENABLE_DOC=TRUE
    make -C doc

Documentation is created and stored at ``doc/www/output``.

2. Set up a web-server. 

Note that if your Tarantool Database runs on a Virtual machine, you need to make sure that your host and client machines operate in the same network, i.e., to configure port forwarding. If you use Oracle VM VirtualBox, follow the guidelines below:

* To create a network, navigate to **Network > Advanced > Port Forwarding** in your VirtualBox instance menu.
* Enable the **Cable connected** checkbox.
* Click the **Port Forwarding** button.
* Set Host and Guest Ports to ``8000``, Host IP to ``127.0.0.1`` and Guest IP to ``10.0.2.15``. Make sure to check the IP of your VB instance, it must be 10.0.2.15 (``ifconfig`` command)
* Save your settings

If all the prerequisites are met, run the following command to set up a web-server (the example below is based on Ubuntu, but the procedure is similar for other supported OS's). Make sure to run it from the documentation output folder, as specified below:

   .. code-block:: bash

     cd ~/tarantool/doc/www/output
     python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

3. Open your browser and enter ``127.0.0.1:8000`` into the address box. If your local documentation build is valid, the HTML version will be displayed in the browser. 

To contribute to documentation, use the ``.rst`` format for drafting and submit your updates as "Pull Requests" via GitHub. 

To comply with the writing and formatting style, use guidelines provided in the documentation, common sense and existing documents. 

Note that if you suggest creating a new documentation section (i.e., a whole new page), it has to be saved to the relevant section at GitHub.  

* Root folder for documentation source files is located at https://github.com/tarantool/tarantool/tree/1.6/doc/sphinx.
* Source files for the developers' guide are located at https://github.com/tarantool/tarantool/tree/1.6/doc/sphinx/dev_guide.
