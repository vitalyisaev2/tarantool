                    The Project
        -------------------------------------

        Tarantool is an open-source in-memory DBMS combined with a Lua application
        server. In some benchmarks it has proven to be faster than any of the
        better-known NoSQL products, and Mail.Ru is committed to making Tarantool
        the best-known as well as the best. The product is in production use
        within many small and large companies, as well as within Mail.Ru itself.

        The features include sharding, replication, write-ahead logging, a variety
        of journal log options, load balancing, Lua stored procedures, connectors for C
        Perl, PHP and Python, modules for interaction with MySQL or PostgreSQL.

        There's a team of developers employed by Mail.Ru which creates and
        distributes Tarantool in the open source community.
