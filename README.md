Tarantool is an in-memory database and application server.

Key features of the application server:
 * 100% compatible drop-in replacement for Lua 5.1,
   based on LuaJIT 2.0.
   Simply use #!/usr/bin/tarantool instead of
   #!/usr/bin/lua in your script.
 * full support for Lua modules and a rich set of
   own modules, including cooperative multitasking,
   non-blocking I/O, access to external databases, etc

Key features of the database:
 * MsgPack data format and MsgPack based
   client-server protocol
 * two data engines: 100% in-memory with
   optional persistence and a 2-level disk-based
   B-tree, to use with large data sets
 * multiple index types: HASH, TREE, BITSET
 * asynchronous master-master replication
 * authentication and access control
 * the database is just a C extension to the
   app server and can be turned off

Supported platforms are Linux/x86 and FreeBSD/x86, Mac OS X.

Tarantool is ideal for data-enriched components of
scalable Web architecture: queue servers, caches,
stateful Web applications.

## Compilation and install

Tarantool is written in C and C++.
To build, you will need GCC or Apple CLang compiler.

CMake is used for configuration management.
3 standard CMake build types are supported:
 * Debug -- used by project maintainers
 * RelWithDebInfo -- the most common release configuration,
 also provides debugging capabilities
 * Release -- use only if the highest performance is required

The build depends on the following external libraries:

- libreadline and libreadline-dev
- GNU bfd (part of GNU binutils).

Please follow these steps to compile Tarantool:

    # If compiling from git
    tarantool $ git submodule update --init --recursive

    tarantool $ cmake .
    tarantool $ make

To use a different release type, say, RelWithDebInfo, use:

    tarantool $ cmake . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo

Additional build options can be set similarly:

    tarantool $ cmake . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -DENABLE_DOC=true # builds the docs

'make' creates 'tarantool' executable in directory src/.

There is 'make install' goal. One can also run Tarantool executable without
installation.

To start the server, try:

    tarantool $ ./src/tarantool

This will start Tarantool in interactive mode.

To run Tarantool regression tests (test/test-run.py),
a few additional Python modules are necessary:
 * PyYAML==3.10
 * argparse==1.1
 * msgpack-python==0.4.6
 * gevent==1.1b5
 * six>=1.8.0

Or run:
```
pip install -r test-run/requirements.txt
```

Simply type 'make test' to fire off the test coverage.
